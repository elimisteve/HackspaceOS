All the excellent people coming to {{ 'BASICS.NAME'|get_config }} should be able to feel comfortable at the space.<br>
That means if anyone is harassing you / makes you feel unsafe, it's perfectly excellent to ask that person to leave and take a break.<br>
<br>
However, that doesn't mean you aren't able to discuss controversal topics at {{ 'BASICS.NAME'|get_config }}. 
But be mindful about having a rational, respectful, mature discussion with others, even if you strongly disagree with them.<br>
<br>
If you feel a situation surpresses aspects of your speech and your speech wasn't intended to be hurtful, talk with people in the space in person about it.

{% elif word == 'SPACEs history' %}
{{ 'BASICS.NAME'|get_config }}'s history:<br>The Up's, Down's & Learnings
